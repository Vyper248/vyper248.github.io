let Summary = "I love to create web apps, especially those that help with productivity in some way or just make a particular experience better. In my free time I love gaming, especially a good open world game that I can get immersed in.";

const Latest_Experience = \`
    From 2013 to 2022 I worked for the family business in the care sector, doing payroll, invoicing, billing etc.

    To help increase my productivity I learned web development to create a tool to automate many of my tasks, starting with html/css/javascript and using php for the backend, eventually moving to EJS/Node/Express and then finally to React/Node/Express.

    These days, I just use Serverless Functions where needed and mostly focus on the frontend with React.

const Previous_Experience = \`
    Before that and after graduating, I experimented with Game Development, creating several games for Apple mobile devices, using XCode with Objective-C and various game engines. While the games did sell in small numbers, I realised this wasn't really as fulfilling as I thought it would be.
